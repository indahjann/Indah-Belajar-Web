            Come stop your crying
            It will be alright
            Just take my hand
            Hold it tight

            I will protect you
            From all around you
            I will be here
            Don't you cry

            For one so small
            You seem so strong
            My arms will hold you
            Keep you safe and warm
            This bond between us
            Can't be broken
            I will be here
            Don't you cry

            Cause you'll be in my heart
            Yes, you'll be in my heart
            From this day on
            Now and forever more

            Yes, you'll be in my heart
            No matter what they say
            You'll be here in my heart
            Always

            Why can't they understand the way we feel
            They just don't trust what they can't explain
            I know we're different, but deep inside us
            We're not that different at all

            And you'll be in my heart
            Yes, you'll be in my heart
            From this day on
            Now and forever more

            Don't listen to them
            'Cause what do they know
            We need each other, to have, to hold
            They'll see in time, I know

            When destiny calls you, you must be strong
            I may not be with you
            But you've got to hold on
            They'll see in time, I know
            We'll show them together

            'Cause you'll be in my heart
            Yes, you'll be in my heart
            From this day on
            Now and forever more

            You'll be in my heart
            No matter what they say
            You'll be here in my heart
            Always
            Always

            Just look over your shoulder
            Just look over your shoulder
            Just look over your shoulder
            Just look over your shoulder
            I'll be there
            Always
